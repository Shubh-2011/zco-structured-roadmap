FOR ZCO YOU MUST EXCEL IN PROBLEM SOLVING, IMPLEMENTATION SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. HERE IS A ROADMAP:-

1- UNDERSTAND A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:-
   KNOWLEDGE OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAG I A MUST FOR YOU. YOU CAN LEARN JAVA,PYTHON, OR C++ FOR ZCO. FOR SPPED C++ IS ADVISED BUT IF YOU ARE A BEGGINER THAN PYTHON IS GOOD    FOR YOU. YOU SHOULD MAKE PROGRAMS LIKE CALCULATORS, TIC TAC TOE AND MULTIPLICATION TABLE PROGRAM ETC. TO IMPROVE YOUR IMPLEMENTATION AND LOGIC.

2- START DOING BEGGINER COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS :-
   ONCE YOU ARE GOOD AT BASICS YOU SHOULD NOW MOVE TO DOING CP PROBLEMS. I HAVE GIVEN LINKS AND SOLUTIONS OF PROBLEMS AND IT WILL BE JUST INCREASING IN FUTURE. DONT       WASTE YOUR TIME ON RANDOM CODEFORCES OR LEET CODE PROBLEMS.

3- LEARN ALGORITHMS.
    YOU SHOULD START LEARNING ALGORITHMS LIKE BACTRACKING, GREEDY, TWO POINTERS AND BASIC DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING. I PERSONALLY RECOMMEND " CP PROGRAMMERS' HANDBOOK" FOR LEARNING ALGORITHMS.
4- DO PYQS.
    IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO DO PAST 5 YEARS PYQS OF ZCO.
