🧠 ZCO Structured Roadmap

From Foundations to Olympiad-Level Thinking

📌 About This Repository

Hi, I’m Shubh Vishwakarma, a school student preparing for the Zonal Computing Olympiad (ZCO).
This repository documents my structured preparation journey, where I focus on core algorithmic thinking, not just solving random problems.

The goal of this repo is:

To build strong fundamentals required for ZCO and higher Olympiads

To practice systematic problem solving

To track my learning with clean code + lessons learned

This is a work in progress, and I update it as I grow.

🗺️ Roadmap Overview
🔹 Phase 1: Foundations (Current Focus)

Recursion fundamentals

Backtracking

Subsets

Permutations

N-Queens

Maze problems

Time complexity intuition

🔹 Phase 2: Core Techniques (Upcoming)

Two pointers

Prefix sums

Binary search on answer

Greedy basics

🔹 Phase 3: Olympiad Thinking (Future)

Dynamic Programming

Graph algorithms

Mathematical problem solving

🧩 Topics & Progress
🔁 Recursion & Backtracking

Problems solved / working on:

Subset Sum (decision problem)

Generating all subsets

Permutations

N-Queens

Maze path finding

Key lessons learned:

Always define the state clearly (index, current choice)

Base cases decide correctness

Backtracking follows a choose → explore → unchoose pattern

Recursion is not magic — it’s controlled repetition

📂 Folder: /backtracking

🛠️ Languages & Tools

Python (primary)

Platforms: CSES, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks

Focus on logic clarity over short code
